[ ] Do as much as you are able to (zombies CRUD and tests are a must) - in case of lack of time, please create a .txt file and describe what you were planning to do. Please mention the tools that you would use and as many implementation details as you can.
You can also include any concerns and questions that arose during the process and you would like to ask the PM. Or maybe you have any ideas on how to improve the app? Whatever comes to your mind - please put it also in the txt file and show us your way of thinking.
