User stories:

I want to display details about selected zombie (name and creation date);
I want to display items that this zombie has;
I want to see total value of zombieâ€™s items in 3 currencies, PLN/EU/USD;
I want to add and remove items from the zombie;
I want to see a list of zombies (create/update/remove them also);


Guidelines:

The zombie can have a maximum of 5 items.
We use an external item exchange for our zombie (we pay for every request), the prices of items on the exchange are updated daily at 00:00 UTC and are in Polish zlotys. https://zombie-items-api.herokuapp.com/api/items
We use the NBP API to download daily exchange rates http://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/tables/C/today/
Please take the RESTful approach or GraphQL - whatever you feel more comfortable with.
Nice to have: app placed on the hosting (heroku/zeit or anything else) or dockerized.
Do as much as you are able to (zombies CRUD and tests are a must) - in case of lack of time, please create a .txt file and describe what you were planning to do. Please mention the tools that you would use and as many implementation details as you can.
You can also include any concerns and questions that arose during the process and you would like to ask the PM. Or maybe you have any ideas on how to improve the app? Whatever comes to your mind - please put it also in the txt file and show us your way of thinking.
